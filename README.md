# Works in Progress

A github.io subdomain is a worthy location for personal musings, 
ideas on new projects, and of course, Works in Progress.

## EQ - and the future

Conversation last night with my long-time friend
Livia and her wonderful daughter and son, Kaleigh and Ben, turned to sustainability.  
An area that we all recognise as critically important, but where we are
all equally seeking solutions, approaches, change, from our own particular 
perspectives.

Ben brought up [EQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence "
Wikipedia Article on Emotional Intelligence") an area that I have never taken
the time to study. He asks whether technology can be used to support developing 
a communal EQ with the goal of saving humanity from itself.

## The stakes are high

Just to make this clear, I feel strongly that we must immediately 'pin' the
atmospheric CO2 level to the current level of around 404 ppm, and 
do all we can to achieve
sustainability within that budget. We should develop an eventual goal of 
reducing CO2 to 350 ppm, or whatever level we can prove does not increase 
any further the risk of planetary collapse.   
At the moment we hand-wave about targets, plans, goals, while     
allowing the CO2 level to creep up, with no end in sight.  

The worrying fact is that scientists are encountering data suggesting we are 
near potential tipping points, where nature will take any remaining control 
out of our hands, and perhaps lead us to a 4 degree warming, which would be
devastating to nature and humanity alike.  Because in recorded history the 
atmosphere has never been forced in the way it is today, scientists cannot
yet say that what safety margin remains, if any.
 
## The EQ issue

The majority of the human population is overburdened with daily life. For
many, just earning a crust is hard. Automation is threatening whole job sectors 
and economic uncertainty has many people very focused on getting and 
retaining jobs.

This leaves little time or energy to engage with such high level themes as
man-made global warming. Indeed, many of us are becoming so focused on survival
that we are ill equipped to approach such topics.

I assert that governments and global business understand very well what is 
happening, but are for a variety of reasons not acting in a timely or effective 
fashion. Ther are certainly not acting with the speed and rigor required in 
the face of a global threat.   

If our personal or societal needs are to be met, and the basic security 
of nature and humanity guaranteed, we will need concerted effort. 
If government is failing in its main role of providing security for current
and future generations given the data we already have, when *is* it going to 
act? Should we wait? Is community action a better approach? Top-down, bottom up?
I don't know.

What is clear is that without what Ben signified as collective EQ, our 
humanity may never reach the threshold of action. I offer that the way our
society is brow-beaten, overburdened, divided by the latest CNN-channelled 
'threat' we may never rise above the threshold of awareness, let alone action.
 
## First steps

So isn't the first step to bring a significant part of humanity, especially 
that part of humanity that generates a large fraction of our climate-changing 
emissions to a communal discussion?  My hope would be that, by raising the 
'collective EQ', communities develop a confidence that they don't 
currently possess to demand progress, or simply enact progress, de-facto.

## What is EQ?

I took a quick look at EQ on Wikipedia. It's a fascinating article, leading
to areas of psychology, intelligence, performance, and so on. 
Despite its use being widespread, the meaning and value of EQ as a measure 
is far from understood. My initial reading puts it as 
a placeholder for self awareness, confidence, self-actuation, and 
similar concepts. There are other more direct measures, for example 
[The Big Five Personality Traits (OCEAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)
that assess along five axes, and allow conclusions to be drawn about
aptitudes, attitudes, and ability.  These measures have been developed over
a longer period, and seem to have predictive value.   

If we could help the general population to develop along the axes that
build confidence, allow assertion of their collective and human-rights, we 
might reach a tipping point where climate progress is driven by the people.
